1602 LCD Driver for Raspberry Pi Pico
This repository contains code and instructions for using a 1602 LCD with a Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython.

Description
This project aims to control a 1602 LCD display via the I2C interface on the Raspberry Pi Pico. The LCD uses a PCF8574 backpack to reduce the number of GPIOs required. The code in this repository is currently under development and we are facing an issue where the LCD does not display anything even though it works with an Arduino. The i2c_scan method does detect the LCD at address 0x27.

Getting Started
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi Pico
1602 LCD display
PCF8574 Backpack
Software Requirements
MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico
Thonny Python IDE (recommended)
Setup and Installation
Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to the PCF8574 backpack and 1602 LCD according to the tutorial here.
Install MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico as per the instructions here.
Clone this repository and open the code in the Thonny Python IDE.
Run the code.
Troubleshooting
If the i2c_scan function returns the LCD address (0x27), but the LCD does not display anything, make sure that the LCD is connected properly and the contrast is set correctly. If it works with an Arduino but not with the Raspberry Pi Pico, it could be a software issue.
